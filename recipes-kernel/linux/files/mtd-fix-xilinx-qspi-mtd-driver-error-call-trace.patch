Subject: [PATCH] mtd: fix xilinx qspi mtd driver error (call trace)

Wihtout this fix, when using QSPI MTD driver, I get the following error:

zynqmp-qspi ff0f0000.spi: rx bus width not found

Note: the error is potentially benign, as I am still able to access (erase,
read, and write) the flash.  However, it appears to be the result of incorrect
of_node_get/put() usage, which could potentially cause a fault.

The issue appears to be that the function spi_nor_scan() in
drivers/mtd/spi-nor/spi-nor.c improperly uses of_get_next_parent() 3 times.
Specifically, as noted in the of_get_next_parent() header comments:

/**
 *	of_get_next_parent - Iterate to a node's parent
 *	@node:	Node to get parent of
 *
 *	This is like of_get_parent() except that it drops the
 *	refcount on the passed node, making it suitable for iterating
 *	through a node's parents.

And, a cursory look through the other uses of this function in the Linux source
(31 other instances) show that it is specifically used to iterate up the
parents.

As a quick fix, if of_get_next_parent() is changed to of_get_parent(), the
issue is resolved.  However, that is not a full fix - the fix should include
of_node_put() when the node no longer needed.  Also, it does not seem necessary
to get the same parent node 3 times, as it would be cleaner and more efficient
to do just one of_get_parent()/of_node_put().

What is curious is that I am getting this error, and I have not seen it
reported online anywhere.  I suspect that I have something subtly different in
my DT that causes the problem to appear.  In addition, this code is still in
the latest Xilinx source on github, so I suspect its occurrence is rare.

Finally, here's my device tree snippet:

&qspi {
    status = "okay";
    is-dual = <0>;

    flash@0 {
        /* Part is: MT25QL02G */
        compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <1>;
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
        partition@0x00000000 {
            label = "qspi-fsbl-uboot";
            reg = <0x0 0x1000000>;
        };
    };
};
