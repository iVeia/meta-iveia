DESCRIPTION

    ivinstall is a self-extracting shell archive that installs Yocto-built
    Linux images (bootloaders, kernel, rootfs) onto iVeia target hardware via
    one of multiple methods (SD, JTAG, SSH).  The script is self-contained: all
    of the required boot images are baked into this script, and therefore it
    can be shared and/or transferred to other users/machines.

    Images are installed onto the given block DEVICE.  The DEVICE refers to the
    actual block device name, so this will vary on the host.  As a convenience
    on the target, the following aliases can be used for the DEVICE:
        - sd0: alias for /dev/mmcblk0 (usually refers to the io-board SD card)
        - sd1: alias for /dev/mmcblk1 (usually refers to the SoM eMMC/SD)
    On SoMs that do not support an external SD card slot, both /dev/mmcblk0 and
    sd0 refer to the SoM eMMC/SD.  See MODE OPTIONS for more details.

    It runs on either a Linux host or the Linux target.  A subset of features
    are supported on other Unix hosts (e.g. macos).

    The files installed and used in the boot process are:
        - Xilinx bootloaders and firmware (e.g. FSBL)
        - U-Boot and its environment
        - Linux kernel and device tree files
        - Rootfs

    All of the above, except the rootfs, are stored on the first partition of
    the SD or eMMC.  The rootfs can be stored in one of two places:
        - As an initramfs (historically named initrd (init ramdisk)) it can be
          stored as a single file named "initrd" along with the other boot
          files.  In this case, the rootfs is loaded into memory, and runtime
          changes to the rootfs are not stored on disk.  On boot, if an initrd
          is found, it will be used.
        - As an ext3 formatted partition on the SD or eMMC.  In this case,
          runtime rootfs changes are saved to disk.  However, the rootfs cannot
          be fully replaced with an updated rootfs at runtime.  To update the
          rootfs, a reboot or alternate method is required.  When used, the
          ext3 image is required in partition 3.

    The bootloader may optionally be burned to QSPI flash using the -q option.

MODE OPTIONS

    The mode selects the method of installation (SD (default), JTAG, or SSH).

    -z
        SD MODE

        The default install option.  Install images to the given DEVICE.
        Optionally partition and format device.  SD mode is fast when
        formatting is not required, but does require manually
        ejecting/inserting SD cards when run on the host.

        The SD card will contain 4 partitions (shown with default label and
        type):
            1) "IVEIA-BOOT", FAT32:     boot files
            2) <unlabeled>, raw:        small partition for optional data
            3) "IVEIA-ROOTFS", EXT4:    Linux root file system
            4) "IVEIA-SDHOME", EXT4:    Linux user data partition

        When using SD mode on the host, ivinstall must be run as root, e.g.,
        "sudo ivinstall ..." to perform a format or ext4 rootfs install.

        For copying without ext4 (i.e. -k or -d options), sudo is not required.
        In this case, the DEVICE can refer to a block device (which must be
        mounted) or a directory to install the boot files.  In addition,
        macos is supported.

        Can be run on a Linux host or target, in both cases DEVICE refers to
        the block device or directory attached to the machine running this
        utility.

    -s SSH_TARGET
        SSH MODE

        Install via ssh to SD card on target.  SSH_TARGET is of the same form
        used by ssh, i.e. [user@]ip_address.  ssh is the fastest method, but
        requires a running target.  Also, ssh cannot update a mounted ext4
        rootfs while the target is running.

        Can only be run on a host.  The DEVICE refers to the device name on the
        target (see DESCRIPTION).

    -j
        JTAG MODE

        Install via JTAG to SD card on target.  Requires installed Vivado
        command line tool xsdb.  This is by far the slowest method, however it
        requires no user intervention, and can completely reformat a target
        even if it is bricked or the network is not available.

        Works by loading all images needed for Linux boot into RAM via JTAG,
        and then booting.  In addition, a shell sourceable STARTUP_SCRIPT and
        EXTRA_IMAGE are loaded into high RAM, and extracted once Linux boots.
        After booting, the STARTUP_SCRIPT is sourced by the shell.  By default,
        the EXTRA_IMAGE is the ivinstall script itself (this program), and the
        STARTUP_SCRIPT launches the ivinstall script with user provided
        arguments.  However, the STARTUP_SCRIPT and EXTRA_IMAGE can either be
        ignored (with the -o option) or replaced (with the -r and/or -R
        options).

        Can only be run on a host.  The DEVICE refers to the device name on the
        target (see DESCRIPTION).

FORMAT OPTIONS

    These options modify the formatting of the DEVICE and the files to be
    installed.  The DEVICE will only be formatted if -f is specified (or an
    option that implies -f).  Files will only be copied if -c is specified (or
    an option that implies -c).

    -b SIZE
        Size in MB of FAT boot partition, default 4GB (or 512MB for SD cards
        less than 16GB).

    -B SIZE
        Size in MB of rootfs partition, default 1024MB.

    -c
        Copy the necessary boot files to the SD card.  Copies rootfs as ext4 to
        partition 3.

    -d
        Copies the initrd instead of ext4 rootfs.  Implies -c (copy).

    -f
        Partition and format the SD card.

    -k
        Skip copying rootfs for faster install.  Implies -c (copy).

    -i IOBOARD
        Target io-board for which the SD card will be configured.  This will
        setup boot to use the correct device tree overlay file, which will
        correctly configure all io-board interfaces.  Implies -c.  See
        SUPPORTED BOARDS for allowed IOBOARDs.

    -n NAME
        Optional volume name (label) prefix for all partitions; default is
        "IVEIA".  Full labels for each partition are shown in section MODE
        OPTIONS.  Implies -f.

    -q
        Reflash the QSPI from Linux on target.  Only valid on target, or when
        run on host via SSH or JTAG modes.  Can be used in conjunction with
        format/copy options.

OTHER OPTIONS

    -A EXTRACT_DIR
        Assemble a new script, given a previously extracted directory of files.
        The commands:
            ivinstall -X EXTRACT_DIR
            ivinstall -A EXTRACT_DIR > new_install_script
        will extract and then reassmble a functionally equivalent script named
        new_install_script.  A user can the extract the files from the
        ivinstall script, edit them, and then reassemble the ivinstall script.
        See also -x and -X.

    -h
        Show this help message and exit.

    -J JTAG_REMOTE
        Run JTAG commands from a remote host that is connected via JTAG to a
        target.  JTAG_REMOTE is of the same form used by ssh, i.e.
        [user@]ip_address.  JTAG_REMOTE machine can be Linux or Windows.  Only
        valid in JTAG MODE or with -Q option.

        If JTAG_REMOTE contains a colon, then it is split into two parts.  The
        first part up the first colon is the ssh form specified above.  The
        rest (after the colon) is a Xilinx xsdb wildcard string to match
        against the jtag_cable_serial field.  This allows multiple JTAG
        adapters to be used on the same remote machine by specifying the serial
        number.

        To determine the valid jtag_cable_serial string reported by xsdb, you
        can run "targets -target-properties" in xsdb, and search for the
        jtag_cable_serial field in the output.  For example, on a Digilent
        JTAG-HS3 adapter a valid serial number is 210299ADAA17, and it could
        be matched using a wildcard string of "*ADAA17*".

        If multiple adapters are connected to a remote machine then the
        jtag_cable_serial wildcard string must be specified or the download
        will fail.

    -o
        Only boot, do not install.  Only valid in JTAG mode.  With this option,
        the target will be booted into Linux using JTAG, but ivinstall will not
        be loaded or run.

    -Q
        Reflash the QSPI only, on a directly connected JTAG target and then
        exit.  Xilinx's xsdb must be available for programming via TCL script.
        This method is prefered over Xilinx's program_flash, which can
        sometimes fail on boards that are hardwired to always boot from QSPI.
        Can be used with JTAG_REMOTE option, to run from a remote host computer
        that has a directly connected JTAG target.

    -r
        Replace the startup script with the given file STARTUP_SCRIPT.  Only
        valid in JTAG mode.  See the -j option.

    -R
        Replace the extra image with the given file EXTRA_IMAGE.  Only valid in
        JTAG mode.  See the -j option.

    -v
        Report version from which images were built and md5sums of all images
        in the archive and then exit.

    -x
        Extract only.  Extract contents of this installer to temp directory
        and then exit.

    -X EXTRACT_DIR
        Extract only.  Same as -x, but with user supplied directory path that
        will be created by this script.

LIMITATIONS

    On macos, the formatting options (i.e. [-fbBn]) are not available.
